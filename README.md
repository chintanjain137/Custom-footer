# Custom-footer
I had made custom footer here . I made this section static because footer section is needed everyWhere in the website.
||  To render this section into your theme use {% render custom-footer.liquid %} into your theme 
|| if you want to make section dynamic use presets Tag into the schema and make it dynamic
